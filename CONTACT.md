# Different ways to contact us:

## IRC
The official channel is `#ZeroPhone` on `freenode`. It's mostly used for casual talk about ZeroPhone and ZPUI development, debugging and issues.
- [webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#ZeroPhone) 
- [logs](https://mozzwald.com/irclog/zerophone/)

If you don't get a response in time (because of timezones and other reasons people might not be online) and have to leave - **please, leave your email address** (or other form of communication) before leaving IRC,
so that we can get back to you (you can PM your contact details to **CRImier**on IRC as well).

## GitHub
We mostly us it for keeping tracks of formal development tasks and bugs
- [ZPUI issues](https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/issues) - for ZPUI tasks and bugs
- [Discussion and research](https://github.com/ZeroPhone/Discussion-and-Research/issues) - for ZeroPhone tasks and bugs
