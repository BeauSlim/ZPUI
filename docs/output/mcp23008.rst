MCP23008 I2C LCD backpack driver
################################

This driver was written for wide.hk I2C LCD backpacks `(picture). <http://www.wide.hk/img/_MG_4713.JPG>`_ 
They are very small and slim and don't have any means to configure their I2C address. If you have another backpack and the driver doesn't work with this one, please `send me an e-mail <mailto:crimier@yandex.ru>`_ with a link to your backpack and its drivers. 

Sample config.json:

.. code:: json

    "input":                
       [{                   
         "driver":"mcp23008",
         "kwargs":          
          {                 
           "addr":62 
          }                 
       }]                  

.. note:: Remember that you need to provide backpack's I2C address in decimal system for the ``config.json`` file.

To test your screen, you can just run ``python output/driver/mcp23008.py`` while your screen is connected to I2C bus (you might want to adjust parameters in driver's ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` section). It will initialize the screen and show some text on it.
