MCP23008 I2C LCD backpack driver
################################

This driver was written for wide.hk I2C LCD backpacks `(picture). <http://www.wide.hk/img/_MG_4713.JPG>`_ 
They are very small and slim and don't have any means to configure their I2C address. 

If you have another backpack and the driver doesn't work with this one, please open an issue on GitHub with a link to the backpack and its drivers for Arduino/Raspberry Pi

Sample config.json:

.. code:: json

    "input":                
       [{                   
         "driver":"mcp23008",
         "kwargs":          
          {                 
           "addr":62 
          }                 
       }]                  

.. note:: Remember that you need to provide backpack's I2C address in decimal system for the ``config.json`` file.

To test your screen, you can just run ``python output/driver/mcp23008.py`` while your screen is connected to I2C bus (you might want to adjust parameters in driver's ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` section). It will initialize the screen and show some text on it.
