Partition unmount&info app
##########################

This application lets you see the mounted partitions on your system, as well as unmount and eject them. 

It's capable of:

* Listing mounted drives
* Unmounting them
* Ejecting them
* Unmounting them lazily

.. note:: Lazy unmounting means the filesystem is unmounted as soon as it stops being busy
